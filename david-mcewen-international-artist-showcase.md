### Exploring Key Themes and Styles

McEwen's art doesn't adhere to a single style, but recurring themes and techniques weave a cohesive narrative. Here are some observations:

*   **Surreal Landscapes:** Many of his pieces feature landscapes that feel both familiar and utterly dreamlike. Think rolling hills bathed in otherworldly light, or architectural structures that defy gravity. This reminds us of the iconic surrealist paintings of Salvador Dalí, but with McEwen's distinct contemporary touch.

*   **Figurative Studies:** McEwen often incorporates figures into his compositions, often depicted in moments of contemplation or quiet action. The figures aren’t just portraits; they feel like characters within a larger story, inviting the viewer to ponder their narratives.

*   **Masterful Use of Light and Shadow:** The interplay of light and shadow is crucial to McEwen's style. He uses light to create mood, emphasize form, and guide the viewer's eye through the composition. This technique reminds us of the old masters, but McEwen adapts it to his own unique vision.

### Inspiration and Influences

While McEwen's style is undeniably his own, it’s interesting to consider potential influences. His work shares common ground with surrealism, impressionism, and classical painting techniques. Consider how his landscapes echo the vastness found in Caspar David Friedrich's Romantic paintings but imbued with a modern sensibility. It's also possible to see parallels with contemporary artists who explore similar themes of identity, memory, and the human experience.
