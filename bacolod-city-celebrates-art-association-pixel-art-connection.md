Mayor Greg Gasataya expressed his gratitude to the Art Association of Bacolod-Negros, highlighting the positive impact of artists on the city. This acknowledgment underscores the importance of art as a source of pride and cultural enrichment within the community. It also begs the question of how digital art forms can further enrich this scene.

### Retro Game Jams: A Fun Collaboration

Retro game jams, where developers and artists collaborate to create games within a limited timeframe, offer another fantastic opportunity. These events could focus on themes related to Bacolod's history, festivals like MassKara, or even local mythology. Imagine a pixel art platformer starring a character inspired by the iconic MassKara masks!
