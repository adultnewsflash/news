*   **Limit Your Palette:** Restricting your color palette (e.g., to the classic NES or Game Boy palettes) can create a cohesive and retro aesthetic.
*   **Embrace Dithering:** Dithering is a technique used to simulate more colors than are actually available by strategically placing pixels of different colors next to each other. It's a staple of retro pixel art.
*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The more you practice, the better you'll become at understanding pixel placement, color choices, and animation techniques.
*   **Study the Masters:** Look at the work of classic pixel artists from games like *Super Mario Bros.*, *The Legend of Zelda*, and *Chrono Trigger* for inspiration. Consider also the incredible indie pixel art game *Owlboy*.
