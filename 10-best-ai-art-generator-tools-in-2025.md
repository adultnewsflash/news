## FAQ: AI Art Generators and You

**Q: Are AI-generated images copyrighted?**

The legal status of AI-generated art is still evolving. Currently, the general consensus is that if a human provides significant creative input (prompt engineering, post-processing), they can claim copyright. However, this is a complex and evolving area of law, so it's essential to stay informed.

**Q: Can I use AI art generators for commercial purposes?**

Yes, most AI art generators allow commercial use, but it's crucial to check the specific terms of service for each platform. Some platforms may require attribution or have restrictions on certain types of use.
