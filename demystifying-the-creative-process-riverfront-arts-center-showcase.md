# Demystifying the Creative Process: Riverfront Arts Center to Showcase Art's Hidden Tools

The Riverfront Arts Center in Stevens Point is turning the art world inside out! Instead of just showcasing finished pieces, their upcoming exhibition peels back the curtain to reveal the fascinating tools, materials, and works-in-progress that bring art to life. Get ready to be inspired as artists recreate their workspaces and share the secrets behind their creations. This exhibition is a must-see for any aspiring or seasoned artist looking to glean insights and connect with the creative journey.

## A Peek Behind the Canvas: Art Unveiled

We often see the final, polished artwork, but rarely do we get a glimpse into the messy, experimental, and iterative process that brought it into being. The Riverfront Arts Center exhibition aims to change that by providing an intimate look at the artist's studio. Imagine walking through a gallery filled not just with paintings, sculptures, and digital art, but also with the very tools and environments that birthed them. This is a fantastic opportunity to learn about different artistic techniques, materials, and workflows.

### More Than Just Finished Products

This exhibition is a refreshing departure from the traditional art show format. By featuring works-in-progress, sketches, and preliminary designs, the Riverfront Arts Center acknowledges that art is a journey, not just a destination. This approach is especially valuable for emerging artists who may feel intimidated by the seemingly flawless final products they see in galleries and online. Seeing the raw materials and the steps involved in creating art can be incredibly empowering and demystifying.

## Connecting with the Creative Process: Digital Artists Take Note

While the Riverfront Arts Center exhibition encompasses a wide range of art forms, the principles it highlights are particularly relevant to digital artists. In the digital realm, the creative process can sometimes feel hidden behind layers of software and hardware. Understanding the tools and techniques used by other digital artists can be incredibly beneficial for improving your own workflow and expanding your creative horizons.

### Tools of the Trade: A Digital Artist's Arsenal

Whether you're a pixel artist using Aseprite, a digital illustrator working in Procreate, or a 3D modeler crafting worlds in Blender, the tools you use play a significant role in shaping your art. The Riverfront Arts Center exhibition serves as a reminder that even in the digital world, the tools are just as important as the artist's vision. Think about how the limitations of retro game consoles like the NES inspired a generation of pixel artists. Or how the tactile feedback of a Wacom tablet can enhance the digital painting experience.

### Drawing Inspiration: The Art of the Workspace

Your workspace, whether it's a physical studio or a digital desktop, can have a profound impact on your creativity. The exhibition's focus on recreated artist workspaces encourages us to consider how our own environments affect our artistic process. Do you prefer a minimalist setup with only the essentials, or a cluttered space filled with inspiration? Experimenting with different workspace configurations can help you discover what works best for your creative flow. This translates to the digital realm as well - organizing your files, customizing your software interface, and curating your online inspiration sources can all contribute to a more productive and enjoyable artistic experience.

## Embrace the Imperfection: Learning from Works-in-Progress

One of the most valuable aspects of the Riverfront Arts Center exhibition is its emphasis on works-in-progress. Seeing unfinished pieces can help artists overcome the fear of making mistakes and embrace the iterative nature of the creative process. Don't be afraid to experiment, to try new things, and to learn from your errors. Even the most experienced artists go through multiple revisions before arriving at a final product.
