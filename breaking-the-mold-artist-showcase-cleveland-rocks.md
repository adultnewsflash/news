They provide a platform for emerging artists to gain exposure, connect with fellow creatives, and receive feedback on their work. Seeing what others are doing, especially those pushing boundaries, can spark new ideas and inspire personal projects. It allows us to escape our digital workspaces and experience art in a physical space, fostering collaboration and a sense of community.
