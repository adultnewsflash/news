# Paul Kenton's 'Liquid Layers' Exhibition: A Digital Artist's Delight

**Dive into the vibrant world of color and texture at Paul Kenton's 'Liquid Layers' exhibition, now showing at the HENI Gallery in London! Running until August 28th, this exhibition is a must-see for any digital artist seeking inspiration and a fresh perspective on traditional art techniques.**

## A Fusion of Traditional and Contemporary Art

Paul Kenton's work beautifully bridges the gap between traditional painting and a contemporary, almost digital aesthetic. Known for his dynamic cityscapes and vivid color palettes, Kenton's 'Liquid Layers' explores texture, light, and movement in a way that resonates deeply with those of us immersed in the digital art world. The exhibition showcases a series of paintings that capture the energy and fluidity of urban environments, almost like witnessing a glitched-out, beautifully rendered simulation.

### Why Digital Artists Should Visit

While Kenton's medium is paint, the principles he employs translate seamlessly to digital art. Here's why 'Liquid Layers' is worth your time:

*   **Color Inspiration:** Kenton's use of bold, contrasting colors can spark fresh ideas for your own digital palettes. Observe how he layers hues and creates depth to achieve stunning visual effects.
*   **Texture Exploration:** Even in the digital realm, texture is key. Kenton's techniques for building layers of paint to create tactile surfaces can inspire new approaches to creating digital textures using tools like Procreate brushes, Photoshop filters, or even procedural generation in software like Substance Designer.
*   **Movement and Energy:** Capturing movement in a still image is a challenge for any artist. Kenton's paintings convey a sense of dynamism that digital artists can emulate through techniques like motion blur, simulated particle effects, and creative compositing.

## HENI Gallery: A Hub for Artistic Innovation

The HENI Gallery, known for showcasing both established and emerging artists, provides the perfect backdrop for Kenton's work. Visiting the gallery itself is an experience, offering a curated environment designed to enhance your appreciation of the art. The gallery is located in London and open from 10 am to 6 pm daily until August 28th.

## Beyond the Gallery: Finding Inspiration Everywhere

Even if you can't make it to London, you can still draw inspiration from Paul Kenton's art. His Instagram account ([https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNSxZdhs8Q2/](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNSxZdhs8Q2/)) offers a glimpse into his creative process and the finished artworks. Analyzing his techniques through online images can be a valuable exercise for digital artists seeking to expand their skills.

Think about how you can translate his bold brushstrokes into pixel art renditions or use his color choices as a starting point for a new digital illustration. Consider the energy and movement in his cityscapes and how you might represent similar concepts in your own work, perhaps in the form of a cyberpunk cityscape with neon lights and glitch effects reminiscent of games like *Cyberpunk 2077* or *Stray*.

Moreover, platforms like ArtStation and DeviantArt offer endless opportunities to discover digital artists who are pushing the boundaries of texture, color, and movement in their own unique ways. Just like Kenton finds inspiration in the urban landscape, we, as digital artists, can find inspiration in the digital world around us.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What are some digital tools I can use to emulate Paul Kenton's textured style?

Consider experimenting with textured brushes in Procreate, Photoshop, or Clip Studio Paint. Digital art software packages such as Corel Painter are also useful for emulating traditional media effects in the digital sphere. Also, look at software like Rebelle, created specifically to emulate traditional watercolours.

### 2. How can I translate the feeling of movement in Kenton's paintings to pixel art?

Pixel art is a very direct medium with restricted canvas resolution, so animation becomes important. You can animate individual parts of the painting, use dithered patterns, or use trails of colour to suggest movement. Using colour cycling can create the feeling of movement without making large changes to the image.

### 3. What are some other artists who blend traditional and digital techniques?

Check out the work of David Hockney, who has embraced digital painting on his iPad, and Beeple, who has made waves in the NFT art world by combining digital illustration with 3D rendering. Many modern comics artists also make use of digital techniques to render their linework and colours.
