From initial sketches to intricate inking, we'll unpack the techniques and inspiration driving this beautiful fusion of art and spirituality, inspired by the viral art by Designsushama.

## A Modern Take on Ancient Deities

The blending of tradition and technology is becoming increasingly popular in the art world. Artists are finding innovative ways to represent classic themes using modern digital tools. This illustration of Shiva and Ganpati is a perfect example, showcasing how digital art can bring new life to familiar subjects. Designsushama's artwork has taken the internet by storm, proving that there's a huge appetite for spiritually-inspired art created with digital tools like Procreate.

## The Power of Procreate for Digital Inking

Procreate has become a go-to tool for digital illustrators, and for good reason. Its intuitive interface, powerful brush engine, and robust features make it ideal for both sketching and inking. Let's explore the different aspects of using Procreate for creating stunning illustrations like this one:

### Sketching the Foundation

Before jumping into inking, a solid sketch is essential. Procreate offers a variety of brushes perfect for laying down the initial forms. Soft pencils or charcoal brushes can help establish the composition and proportions of Shiva and Ganpati. Experiment with different poses and layouts to find what resonates with you.

*   **Pro Tip:** Use layers! Separate your sketch layer from your inking layer to avoid accidentally altering your sketch as you ink.

### Mastering the Inking Process

The inking stage is where the illustration truly comes to life. Procreate's inking brushes offer a wide range of styles, from crisp, clean lines to textured, organic strokes. Experiment with different brush settings like size, opacity, and pressure sensitivity to achieve the desired effect.

*   **Popular Brushes:** The Technical Pen and Studio Pen are popular choices for clean linework. For a more traditional look, try using the Dry Ink or Syrup brushes.
*   **Layering for Depth:** Use multiple layers for different elements of the inking. This allows you to easily edit and adjust individual parts of the illustration without affecting the rest.

### Adding Detail and Texture

Once the basic linework is complete, you can add details and texture to enhance the illustration. Use smaller brushes to create intricate patterns, shading, and highlights. Experiment with different textures to add depth and realism to the artwork. Consider techniques like stippling or cross-hatching for added visual interest.

*   **Custom Brushes:** Don't be afraid to explore custom brushes! The Procreate community is full of talented artists who share their custom brush sets. You can find brushes specifically designed for creating textures, patterns, and other unique effects.

## Influences and Inspiration

Traditional Indian art forms often inspire modern digital illustrations of deities like Shiva and Ganpati. The use of vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and symbolic imagery are common elements. Artists often draw inspiration from ancient scriptures, mythology, and folklore.

The rise of digital art communities on platforms like Instagram and Twitter has also played a significant role in popularizing this trend. Artists like Designsushama are able to share their work with a global audience, inspiring others to create their own digital interpretations of traditional themes.

## The Allure of Retro Art Styles

While this particular style leans towards modern digital illustration, many artists are also exploring retro pixel art styles when depicting deities and mythological figures. The simplicity and charm of pixel art can create a unique and nostalgic feel. Consider exploring tools like Aseprite for creating pixel art representations of Shiva and Ganpati.
