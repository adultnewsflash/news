### How to embrace eclectic Art?

Here are a few tips for digital artists looking to explore different techniques and grow:

*   **Experiment with Different Software:** Don't limit yourself to one program. Explore the capabilities of various tools, such as Photoshop, Procreate, or even free alternatives like Krita or Piskel.
