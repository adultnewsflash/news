# WA Art Hubs Get a Creative Boost: Funding Injects Life into Regional Galleries!

**Exciting news for pixel pushers, retro revivalists, and digital dreamers in Western Australia!** Regional art hubs are about to receive a significant funding boost, promising new opportunities for artists and art lovers alike. This infusion of resources, spearheaded by the Department of Local Government, Sport and Cultural Industries, aims to invigorate the visual arts scene outside of the major metropolitan areas. Read on to find out what this means for you and your creative practice!

## A Breath of Fresh Air for Regional Art

The Regional Exhibition Touring Boost initiative is designed to inject much-needed investment into regional visual arts activity and to help regional galleries build capacity. For artists working with pixel art, digital illustrations, or any art form embracing retro styles, this could be the chance to showcase your work to new audiences and connect with fellow creatives in vibrant regional settings. Imagine exhibiting your 8-bit masterpieces in a gallery nestled amongst the breathtaking landscapes of Western Australia! 

### What This Means for Artists

*   **Increased Exhibition Opportunities:** The funding will support more frequent and higher-quality exhibitions in regional galleries, providing artists with more platforms to display their work. Think about the possibilities of showcasing your pixel art alongside traditional paintings, creating unique and engaging juxtapositions.
*   **Skill Development and Workshops:** A portion of the funding is earmarked for capacity building, which includes workshops, training programs, and mentorship opportunities. This means a chance to hone your skills in areas like animation, digital painting, or even learn new techniques specific to the retro art style you love.
*   **Networking and Collaboration:** Regional art hubs become focal points for artists to connect, collaborate, and share ideas. Imagine attending a pixel art workshop in a gallery in the Kimberley, connecting with other artists inspired by the vast Australian landscape, and potentially collaborating on a new project.

### Beyond the Gallery Walls

This initiative isn't just about galleries; it's about fostering a thriving artistic ecosystem. The funding can also support art projects that extend beyond the walls of the gallery, such as public art installations, community art workshops, and digital art projections. This allows for a more inclusive and accessible art experience for everyone, reaching people who may not typically visit galleries. Think about creating a large-scale pixel art mural on a public building, bringing your digital artistry to the streets and making it accessible to the wider community.

## Digital Art and Retro Trends: A Perfect Fit

The timing of this funding boost is perfect, considering the resurgence of interest in retro art styles and the growing popularity of digital art. Pixel art, with its nostalgic appeal and unique aesthetic, is finding its way into games like *Shovel Knight* and *Stardew Valley*, and digital illustration is constantly evolving with tools like [Procreate](https://procreate.art/) and [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). This provides artists working in these mediums with a fantastic opportunity to leverage the funding to showcase their work and further establish themselves in the art world.

### Exploring Western Australian Inspiration

Western Australia offers a unique source of inspiration for artists of all types. The vibrant colors of the outback, the striking contrasts of the coast, and the rich cultural heritage of the region provide endless possibilities for creating compelling artwork. Consider drawing inspiration from the iconic landscapes of the Pinnacles Desert or the vibrant colors of the Bungle Bungle Range. Even re-imagining classic Australian folklore with a pixel art twist could be a winning concept!
