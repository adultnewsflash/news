## How to Prepare for Your MICA Summer Art Camp Adventure

While MICA provides all the necessary art supplies, it's always a good idea to bring your own sketchbook, pencils, and any preferred art tools. This can include your favorite graphics tablet or stylus for digital projects! Also, remember to pack comfortable clothing and shoes, as you'll be spending a lot of time in the studio.

Beyond the practical considerations, it's important to come prepared with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Be ready to step outside of your comfort zone, experiment with new techniques, and embrace the creative process.

## Fueling Your Artistic Journey: Inspiration & Resources

Before you head to camp, immerse yourself in the art world! Check out online galleries like ArtStation or DeviantArt for inspiration. Explore the works of influential artists, both classic and contemporary. Experiment with different art styles and techniques. The more you explore, the more you'll discover your own unique artistic voice. Think of artists like Loish for modern digital illustration or the classic masters of pixel art like Henk Nieborg.

Also, consider using this time to familiarize yourself with different digital art software like Clip Studio Paint, or Krita, all of which are excellent options for digital artists.
