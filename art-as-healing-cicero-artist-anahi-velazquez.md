### Digital Tools for Healing and Expression

While Anahi might use traditional art mediums, digital tools are also increasingly popular for creative expression and art therapy. Software like Adobe Photoshop, Procreate, and even accessible pixel art editors like Piskel can provide artists with a wide range of options for exploring their emotions and creating powerful visual statements. Retro art styles are also making a comeback, offering a nostalgic and comforting aesthetic for artists seeking to express themselves through familiar visuals.
