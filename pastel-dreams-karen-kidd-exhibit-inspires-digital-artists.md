# Pastel Dreams: Karen Kidd's Exhibit Inspires Digital Artists at Art on 3rd

Karen Kidd's pastel exhibit at Art on 3rd in Fish Creek is a beautiful showcase of the pastel medium. But what can digital artists glean from this traditional art form? This article explores how Kidd's work, and pastel art in general, can influence and inspire your pixel art, digital illustrations, and retro art styles. Get ready to infuse your digital creations with soft, dreamy hues and a newfound appreciation for texture!

## Discovering the Magic of Pastels

Pastel art, often overlooked in the digital age, possesses a unique charm. The medium itself allows for a direct, tactile connection between the artist and the surface, resulting in pieces rich in texture and subtle color variations. Karen Kidd's exhibit highlights these qualities, demonstrating the power of pastels to capture light, form, and emotion.

### The Allure of Soft Hues

Pastels are renowned for their soft, muted tones. This inherent quality translates beautifully to the digital realm. Think of iconic retro games like *EarthBound*, where pastel palettes create a sense of whimsy and nostalgia. By studying Kidd's work, digital artists can learn to effectively utilize a range of pastel shades to evoke specific moods and atmospheres in their own creations.

### Texture and Gradients in Digital Art

One of the biggest challenges in digital art is replicating the texture found in traditional media. While we can't physically feel the chalky smoothness of a pastel on a screen, we can visually mimic it. Consider how artists use techniques like dithering in pixel art to create the illusion of blended colors and gradients â€“ similar to how pastels are blended on paper. Software like Procreate and Adobe Photoshop offer brushes and tools that allow you to simulate the textures of pastels, giving your digital paintings a more organic feel.

## Inspiration for Pixel Artists

Pixel art, despite its low resolution, can greatly benefit from the pastel aesthetic. Here are some ways to incorporate this influence:

### Creating Dreamy Landscapes

Imagine a pixel art landscape bathed in the soft glow of a pastel sunset. Using a limited color palette with subtle variations, you can create a sense of depth and atmosphere. Think of games like *Stardew Valley* and how they use color to create a sense of place. Consider how Kidd's landscapes in the exhibit capture the unique light of Door County; try and capture a similarly unique sense of place in your own pixel art.

### Character Design with Soft Edges

Instead of harsh, defined lines, explore softer edges for your pixel art characters. Using a slightly desaturated color palette can give them a gentler, more approachable appearance. Consider the character designs in the game *Animal Crossing*. You could use a tool like Aseprite to experiment with creating character designs inspired by Kidd's aesthetic.

## Retro Art Styles and Pastel Palettes

Retro art styles are all about capturing the look and feel of older technology. Pastel palettes, often used in 8-bit and 16-bit games, can add a layer of authenticity to your work.

### Experimenting with Limited Palettes

Challenge yourself to create a retro game mockup using a limited pastel palette. This exercise forces you to be creative with color choices and encourages you to think about how different colors interact with each other. Use resources like Lospec ([https://lospec.com/palette-list](https://lospec.com/palette-list)) to find inspiration for limited color palettes that incorporate pastel hues.

### Adding Grain and Noise

To further enhance the retro aesthetic, consider adding grain or noise to your digital artwork. This subtle effect can mimic the imperfections of older screens and printers, adding a layer of realism and texture.

## Finding Your Pastel Voice

Karen Kidd's pastel exhibit serves as a reminder that traditional art forms can be a source of inspiration for digital artists. By studying the techniques and principles of pastel art, you can enrich your digital creations with soft hues, subtle textures, and a newfound appreciation for the beauty of imperfection. So, embrace the pastel dream and let your creativity soar!
