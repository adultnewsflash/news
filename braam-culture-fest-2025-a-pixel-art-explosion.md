This vibrant festival promises to be a melting pot of urban culture, and we're anticipating a strong showing of the digital arts, especially pixel art, inspired by the unique energy of the city.

## What's Braam Culture Fest?

Braam Culture Fest is an annual celebration of Johannesburg's dynamic urban landscape. It showcases the best of the city's music, art, fashion, food, and more. This year, taking place in 2025, the festival is expected to be bigger and bolder than ever before, attracting artists and creatives from across South Africa and beyond.

### Why Pixel Art and Retro Styles Will Shine

We believe that pixel art and retro aesthetics are perfectly suited to capture the spirit of Braamfontein.
