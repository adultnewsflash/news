## Why You Should Go

### Discover New Talent and Inspiration

The tour is a treasure trove of artistic discovery. You'll encounter artists you might not otherwise find, each with a unique perspective and creative vision. It's a fantastic way to expand your artistic horizons and find inspiration for your own creative endeavors.

### Experience Art in the Making

Visiting artists in their studios offers a rare glimpse into the creative process. You can see the tools and techniques they use, learn about their inspirations, and gain a deeper understanding of their work. This immersive experience is far more engaging than simply viewing art in a gallery.

### Support Local Artists

Attending the tour is a tangible way to support the local arts community. By purchasing art, offering encouragement, and simply showing your appreciation, you contribute to the vitality and sustainability of the artistic ecosystem.

### Connect with the Community

The South Orange/Maplewood Artist Studio Tour is a community event that brings together artists, art lovers, and neighbors. It's a great opportunity to meet new people, share your passion for art, and celebrate the creative spirit of the towns. Consider attending with friends and making it a collaborative journey of artistic exploration.

## Preparing for Your Tour

While details on specific artists and studio locations can likely be found via local listings (like the Village Green article cited), here are some general tips for planning your visit:

*   **Check Local Listings:** Look for event listings to understand locations, hours, and maps to use to plan your tour.
*   **Plan Your Route:** With studios scattered throughout South Orange and Maplewood, it's a good idea to plan your route in advance. Consider using a map or GPS to optimize your travel time. Group studios geographically to minimize travel.
*   **Wear Comfortable Shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking, so wear comfortable shoes. Consider using a map and plotting the stops you want to make.
*   **Bring Cash (Optional):** While many artists accept credit cards, it's always a good idea to have some cash on hand, especially for smaller purchases or donations.
*   **Be Respectful:** Remember that you are visiting artists in their personal spaces. Be respectful of their work and their time.

## Will We See Digital Art?

While traditionally focused on more physical mediums, digital art is increasingly making its presence felt in various art scenes. Keep an eye out! You might find artists incorporating digital techniques into their work, or even artists creating purely digital pieces. Who knows, maybe you'll discover someone who is blending pixel art with traditional painting techniques!

Speaking of digital art, if you're interested in creating your own, tools like [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) (for pixel art), [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) (for iPad illustration), and [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) are excellent places to start.
