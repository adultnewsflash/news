# Shape the Future: Community Art Project Coming to East County Library!

Calling all pixel pushers, digital dreamers, and creative community members in Gresham!  An exciting opportunity to directly influence public art is coming to the East County Library. Artists Ka'ila Farrell-Smith and Paula Champagne are facilitating a series of workshops and activities to gather input and inspiration for a brand new public artwork. Read on to find out how *you* can be a part of it!

## Your Voice, Your Art: A Chance to Collaborate

Tired of the same old bland public spaces? This is your chance to inject some creativity and personality into your community! The City of Gresham is partnering with artists Ka'ila Farrell-Smith and Paula Champagne to create a public art piece for the East County Library. And they want *your* input.

These aren't your stuffy, behind-closed-doors art committees. Ka'ila and Paula are actively seeking community involvement to ensure the final artwork reflects the values and spirit of Gresham. They will be hosting a series of engaging activities designed to spark creativity and gather ideas.

## Who Are the Artists?

It's important to know who's guiding this exciting project! While CreativePixelVibe.art focuses on pixel art and digital mediums, we appreciate art in *all* its forms, and celebrating artists who champion community engagement is right up our alley.  Let's take a peek:

*   **Ka'ila Farrell-Smith:** A contemporary artist (check out her website and socials for examples of her work!) who often incorporates indigenous perspectives and storytelling into her pieces.  Expect a piece that is both thought-provoking and visually engaging.
*   **Paula Champagne:** Another talented artist known for her collaborative spirit and ability to bring people together through art. Her involvement promises a dynamic and inclusive design process.

Together, they form a powerful artistic duo poised to create something truly special for Gresham. We hope they'll incorporate a bit of digital art inspiration from you!

Details about specific workshop dates, times, and locations (presumably at the East County Library or nearby) can be found on the City of Gresham's events calendar (linked below!). This is where you'll get hands-on experience and contribute your unique vision.

Expect a variety of activities designed to stimulate your creativity:

*   **Community Feedback Sessions:** Review and discuss proposed designs, providing constructive criticism and suggestions.

## Why This Matters: Public Art and Community

Public art is more than just decoration. It's a reflection of a community's identity, values, and aspirations. It can:

*   **Enhance Public Spaces:** Transform ordinary spaces into vibrant and engaging environments.
*   **Foster Community Pride:** Create a sense of belonging and shared ownership.
*   **Stimulate Dialogue:** Spark conversations and encourage critical thinking.
*   **Inspire Creativity:** Encourage people to see the world in new ways and express themselves artistically.
