*   **Inspiration from the Masters:** Explore the works of pixel art legends like Paul Robertson or check out retro game art from classics like *Super Mario World* and *The Secret of Monkey Island*.

## Finding Your Style

One of the most rewarding aspects of creating art is discovering your own unique style. Don't be afraid to experiment with different techniques, mediums, and subject matter. Here are some tips:

*   **Study the Masters:** Analyze the works of artists you admire. What techniques do they use? What makes their style unique?
*   **Experiment with Different Mediums:** Try painting, drawing, sculpting, digital art, and see what resonates with you.
*   **Embrace Your Mistakes:** Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process. Don't be afraid to make them! They can often lead to unexpected discoveries.
