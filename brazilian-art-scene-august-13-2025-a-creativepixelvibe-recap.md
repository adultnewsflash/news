## Remembering Carlos Lemos: A Collaborative Legacy

This week also marks a moment of sadness as we remember Carlos Lemos, a renowned architect and close collaborator of the legendary Oscar Niemeyer. Lemos played a crucial role in shaping some of Brazil's most iconic architectural landmarks.

### Lemos' Influence on Visual Design

Although primarily an architect, Lemos' work with Niemeyer embodies a distinct visual style – flowing curves, bold lines, and a sense of futuristic optimism. These elements have undoubtedly influenced various design fields, including visual art and even video game design. Consider the architectural styles in games like *Horizon Zero Dawn* or *Cyberpunk 2077*. Many draw inspiration from real-world movements like Brazilian Modernism. Next time you are designing a city landscape in pixel art, think of Carlos Lemos' vision!

## Oscar Niemeyer's Enduring Impact

Speaking of Niemeyer, his legacy continues to inspire artists and designers. His unique architectural style, characterized by sweeping curves and a futuristic aesthetic, is instantly recognizable. His work serves as a constant reminder that art can be both functional and beautiful.

### Incorporating Niemeyer's Style into Pixel Art

Challenge yourself to create a pixel art rendition of one of Niemeyer's famous buildings. Pay close attention to the curves and proportions to capture the essence of his design. Consider using a limited color palette to evoke the feeling of the mid-century modern era. This exercise can help you develop your pixel art skills and appreciate the influence of architecture on art.
