## What to Expect in a Temporary Entry-Level Role

These positions typically involve a variety of tasks. While the specific duties vary from gallery to gallery, common responsibilities include:

### Art Handling & Installation

Greeting visitors, answering questions about the art, and processing sales are common tasks. Excellent communication and interpersonal skills are necessary to create a welcoming and informative experience for gallery visitors.
