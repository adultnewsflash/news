**The Orlando Museum of Art (OMA) is actively seeking Latin American and Hispanic artists to enrich its collection! This is a fantastic opportunity for creatives to gain exposure and contribute to a more diverse and representative art world. Read on to learn how you can participate!**

## A Call for Cultural Voices

The vibrant tapestry of Latin American and Hispanic culture is rich with stories, perspectives, and artistic expressions that deserve to be celebrated and shared. The Orlando Museum of Art recognizes this and is making a concerted effort to showcase the talent of artists from these communities. This initiative is a significant step towards inclusivity and representation within the art world, providing a platform for voices that have often been underrepresented.

### Why This Matters

For artists, this call represents more than just an exhibition opportunity. It's a chance to:

*   **Gain Recognition:** Exhibit your work in a reputable museum and reach a broader audience.
*   **Share Your Story:**  Connect with viewers through your unique cultural perspective and artistic vision.
*   **Contribute to Diversity:** Help shape a more inclusive and representative art landscape.
*   **Boost Your Career:** Participating in museum exhibitions can significantly enhance your artistic resume and open doors to future opportunities.

## Who Should Apply?

This call is open to Latin American and Hispanic artists working in a variety of mediums. Whether you're a pixel artist crafting nostalgic game landscapes, a digital illustrator creating vibrant characters, or an artist exploring retro styles with a modern twist, the OMA is interested in seeing your work.

Consider these categories, inspired by our CreativePixelVibe.art community:

*   **Pixel Art Pioneers:** If you're creating captivating pixel art landscapes or character designs, this is your chance to showcase your unique style. Think of artists like eBoy, masters of isometric pixel art, and consider how your work fits within that lineage.
*   **Digital Illustration Innovators:** Illustrators pushing the boundaries of digital art, especially those incorporating cultural narratives, are highly encouraged to apply. Artists like Loish, known for her expressive character designs, can serve as inspiration.
*   **Retro Revivalists:** Artists who embrace retro aesthetics, whether through pixel art, 8-bit graphics, or other vintage-inspired styles, are welcome.  Think about how your art echoes the golden age of gaming, perhaps drawing inspiration from classic games like *Super Metroid* or *The Secret of Monkey Island*.
