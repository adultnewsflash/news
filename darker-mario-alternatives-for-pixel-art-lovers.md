# Level Up Your Darkness: Best Games Like Mario, But With an Edge

Craving a platforming fix but want something a little less… sunny? If you're a fan of Mario's tight controls and rewarding level design, but yearn for a world with a darker atmosphere and perhaps a more challenging narrative, you're in the right place. We've compiled a list of games that capture the *essence* of Mario, but with a decidedly darker twist. Perfect for pixel art enthusiasts and gamers seeking a fresh, shadowy adventure.

## Why Explore Darker Mario Alternatives?

Mario games are iconic for a reason: their tight gameplay, colorful visuals, and instantly recognizable characters. But sometimes, you want something with a bit more grit, a more mature story, or perhaps even a touch of horror. These games offer a similar platforming experience but explore themes and aesthetics that Mario wouldn't dare touch. For digital artists, they also offer inspiring examples of how pixel art can be used to create diverse and evocative moods.

## Games That Bring the Gloom

Here are some titles that capture the spirit of Mario while venturing into darker territories:

### 1. *GRIS*

*GRIS* is a breathtaking platformer with a stunning watercolor art style. While it doesn't feature traditional enemies or combat, its themes of grief and overcoming adversity create a deeply moving and atmospheric experience. The lack of spoken dialogue allows the visuals and music to tell a powerful story, making it a truly unique and unforgettable game. It’s a masterpiece of indie game design, and the art direction is simply sublime. Think of it as a playable painting. Great inspiration for digital artists wanting to use color (or lack thereof) to convey emotion. The rewind mechanic keeps the gameplay engaging.

### 2. *Hollow Knight*

This Metroidvania masterpiece takes place in the decaying kingdom of Hallownest. You play as a silent knight exploring a vast, interconnected world filled with challenging platforming sections, intricate combat, and a haunting atmosphere. *Hollow Knight*'s hand-drawn visuals are gorgeous, and its lore is rich and mysterious.  The sheer scale of the game, coupled with its demanding difficulty, makes it a truly rewarding experience for dedicated players.  Expect a similar exploration focus but with a much darker narrative than you might find in the Mushroom Kingdom.

### 3. *Limbo*

*Limbo* is a black-and-white puzzle-platformer that puts you in control of a young boy navigating a treacherous and surreal world. Its minimalist art style and haunting sound design create a truly unsettling atmosphere. Expect to die… a lot. But each death is a learning experience, guiding you towards solving the game's challenging puzzles.  Its visual style has inspired countless artists and game developers, demonstrating the power of simplicity in creating a memorable and evocative experience. For pixel artists, *Limbo* offers a masterclass in using limited color palettes and silhouette to create a powerful visual impact.

### 4. *Little Nightmares*

While not strictly a platformer in the same vein as Mario, *Little Nightmares* offers a similarly engaging experience with a much darker tone. You play as Six, a young girl trapped in a terrifying vessel filled with grotesque creatures. The game's atmospheric visuals, chilling sound design, and unsettling story create a truly unforgettable horror experience. The puzzle-solving elements and stealth mechanics provide a satisfying challenge, while the game's themes of childhood fears and vulnerability resonate deeply.

### 5. *Owlboy*

This visually stunning game features a retro-inspired pixel art style with modern sensibilities. You play as Otus, a mute owl boy struggling to prove himself. *Owlboy* offers a unique blend of platforming and shooting mechanics, with a focus on aerial exploration. The game's heartwarming story, memorable characters, and breathtaking visuals make it a true standout in the indie scene. The pixel art is incredibly detailed, showcasing what's possible with a skilled hand and a passion for the craft.  Consider it a more hopeful story than other entries here, but the world still has plenty of danger and melancholic undertones.
