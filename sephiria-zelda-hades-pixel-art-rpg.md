## A Winning Formula: Zelda Meets Hades

Imagine exploring a vibrant, handcrafted world reminiscent of *A Link to the Past*, but with procedurally generated dungeons and upgrade systems that keep each playthrough fresh, much like *Hades*.

### Top-Down Action with a Rogue-lite Twist

*   **Zelda-inspired Combat:** Expect fluid, engaging combat where timing and positioning are key. You'll need to master your swordplay and utilize various items and abilities to overcome challenging enemies.
*   **Procedural Generation:** No two playthroughs are the same! Dungeons are randomly generated, offering a new and unpredictable experience each time you venture in.
*   **Permadeath and Progression:** Embracing the rogue-lite formula, Sephiria features permadeath. When you fall in battle, you'll start over, but you'll retain some progress and unlock new abilities, making each run a little easier and more strategic.

## The Allure of Pixel Art

The vibrant colors, detailed environments, and charming character designs create a world that's both nostalgic and captivating. For artists and fans of the pixel art style, Sephiria is a testament to the enduring power and beauty of this medium. Consider using tools like Aseprite or Piskel if you're inspired to create your own pixel art!

### Why Pixel Art Still Resonates
