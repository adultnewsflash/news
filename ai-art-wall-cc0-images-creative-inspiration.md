## Exploring the CC0 Landscape

AI Art Wall is a great resource, but it's also worth exploring other CC0 image sources:

*   **Unsplash:** While primarily photography-focused, Unsplash offers a vast library of high-resolution images that can be used for inspiration and reference.

## Considerations When Using AI-Generated Art

While CC0 images are free to use, it's essential to be mindful of the following:

*   **Quality:** AI-generated art can vary in quality. Be selective and choose images that are visually appealing and suitable for your project.
*   **Uniqueness:** Because these images are publicly available, there's a chance that others might use them as well. Consider adding your own creative spin to the images to make them unique.
*   **Ethical Implications:**  The AI art space is still evolving, so consider the ethical implications of AI-generated art, such as its impact on human artists and the use of datasets.
