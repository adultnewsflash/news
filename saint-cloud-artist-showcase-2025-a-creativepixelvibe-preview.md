## Finding Inspiration: From Traditional to Digital

Even if you can't attend the 2025 Artist Showcase in person, you can still draw inspiration from its spirit of creativity. Here are some ideas:

*   **Explore Regional Art:** Research art from Central Minnesota. Look for patterns, color palettes, or themes that resonate with you and could be translated into your pixel art or digital illustrations.
*   **Experiment with New Styles:** Challenge yourself to incorporate elements of traditional art into your digital work. Could you emulate the brushstrokes of a painter in Procreate? Or the texture of a sculpture in a 3D modeling program?
*   **Connect with Other Artists:** Use the showcase as a reminder to connect with other artists in your community, both online and offline. Share your work, provide feedback, and collaborate on projects. Platforms like Behance and Dribbble are great places to start.
*   **Pixel Art and Retro Games:** Remember to stay inspired. Retro games such as Stardew Valley, and its unique pixel art and character-driven narrative, could be a constant beacon for creating engaging art.
