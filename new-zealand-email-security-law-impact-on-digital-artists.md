# Are New Zealand Digital Artists Ready for Stricter Email Security Laws?

Are you a digital artist in New Zealand? New regulations regarding email security are on the horizon, and it's essential to understand how they might affect your creative workflow and the protection of your valuable digital assets. Let's dive into what's happening and what you, as a digital artist, can do to prepare.

## The Incoming Email Security Law: What's the Buzz?

Recently, SecurityBrief New Zealand reported that many New Zealand government bodies are not yet prepared for upcoming stricter email security laws. While this news specifically targets governmental organizations, it serves as a wake-up call for everyone handling sensitive data online, including freelancers and studios in the digital art space. This impending shift underscores the increasing importance of robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard information transmitted via email.

### Why Should Digital Artists Care?

As digital artists, you likely deal with: 

*   **Copyrighted artwork:** Your original creations are valuable intellectual property.
*   **Client communications:** Contracts, project details, and sensitive information are often shared via email.
*   **Payment details:** Invoices, bank account numbers, and payment confirmations are critical data.

Without adequate email security, this information becomes vulnerable to interception, theft, and misuse. A breach can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal issues. Imagine losing your artwork to unauthorized reproduction or having your client's personal data compromised – the consequences can be devastating.

## Understanding the Risks and Taking Action

So, what practical steps can you take to boost your email security and protect your digital assets? Here are a few areas to consider:

### 1. Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

This is Cybersecurity 101, but it's worth repeating! Use strong, unique passwords for all your email accounts and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. Password managers like LastPass or 1Password can help you generate and securely store complex passwords.

### 2. Email Encryption: Shield Your Communications

Email encryption is a critical tool for protecting sensitive information. Encryption scrambles your emails, making them unreadable to anyone without the decryption key. Consider using services like ProtonMail or Tutanota, which offer end-to-end encryption. Many email clients, such as Thunderbird, also support encryption using S/MIME or PGP.

### 3. Be Wary of Phishing Scams

Phishing emails are designed to trick you into revealing sensitive information. Be cautious of suspicious emails asking for your password, bank details, or any other personal information. Always double-check the sender's address and avoid clicking on links from unknown or untrusted sources. Remember, even seemingly legitimate emails can be cleverly disguised phishing attempts. 

### 4. Secure File Sharing Practices

Avoid sending large files or sensitive information directly through email. Instead, use secure file-sharing services like WeTransfer Pro, Dropbox (with password protection and expiration dates), or Tresorit. These platforms offer encryption and access control features to ensure that your files remain secure during transit and storage.

### 5. Stay Updated on Cybersecurity Best Practices

The digital landscape is constantly evolving, and new security threats emerge regularly. Stay informed about the latest cybersecurity best practices by following reputable security blogs, attending webinars, and subscribing to newsletters from cybersecurity experts. Resources like the CERT NZ (Computer Emergency Response Team) provide valuable information and alerts on emerging threats.

## FAQ: Email Security for Digital Artists

Here are some frequently asked questions about email security for digital artists:

**Q: Is free email good enough for professional use?**
A: While free email providers like Gmail and Outlook are convenient, they may not offer the same level of security as paid or encrypted services. For professional use, especially when dealing with sensitive client data and intellectual property, consider investing in a more secure email solution.

**Q: What is end-to-end encryption?**
A: End-to-end encryption ensures that only the sender and recipient can read the message. The email is encrypted on the sender's device and decrypted only on the recipient's device, preventing anyone in between (including the email provider) from accessing the content.

**Q: What should I do if I suspect my email has been hacked?**
A: Immediately change your password, enable two-factor authentication, and notify your contacts that your account may have been compromised. Check your sent items for any suspicious emails and scan your devices for malware. You may also want to consider contacting a cybersecurity professional for assistance.
