The Fisher's Ghost Art Award, held annually at the Campbelltown Arts Centre in Australia, is a prestigious event that welcomes submissions from artists across various mediums, including digital art! This guide will give you the inside scoop on the 2025 award and how to prepare a winning submission.

## What is the Fisher's Ghost Art Award?

The Fisher's Ghost Art Award is an annual art competition and exhibition hosted by the Campbelltown Arts Centre in New South Wales, Australia. It's a significant event on the Australian art calendar, attracting artists from around the country. Named after the local legend of Frederick Fisher, the award celebrates contemporary art and provides a platform for artists to explore diverse themes and techniques. While not exclusively focused on digital art, the competition embraces it as a legitimate and exciting art form.

## Why Should Digital Artists Participate?

The art world is evolving, and digital art is gaining increasing recognition. Participating in the Fisher's Ghost Art Award offers several benefits for digital artists:

*   **Exposure:** Your work will be seen by a wide audience, including art critics, collectors, and fellow artists.
*   **Validation:** Being selected for the exhibition is a great achievement and validates your artistic talent.

## Preparing Your Digital Art Submission for 2025

Submitting your digital art requires careful preparation. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Understand the Guidelines

The most crucial step is to thoroughly read the entry guidelines on the Campbelltown Arts Centre website ([https://c-a-c.com.au/2025-fishers-ghost-art-award-exhibition/](https://c-a-c.com.au/2025-fishers-ghost-art-award-exhibition/)). Pay close attention to:

*   **Eligibility criteria:** Are you eligible to enter?
*   **Entry fees:** What is the cost of submitting your work?
*   **Submission deadlines:** When is the deadline for entries?
*   **Artwork specifications:** Are there any limitations on size, medium, or subject matter? How do you submit digital files (resolution, format, etc.)?
*   **Copyright and licensing:** Understand the terms and conditions regarding copyright.

### 2. Choose Your Best Work

Select a piece that showcases your unique style and technical skills. Consider the following:

*   **Originality:** Does your work stand out and offer a fresh perspective?
*   **Technical proficiency:** Is your work well-executed and visually appealing?
*   **Concept:** Does your work have a clear and compelling concept?
*   **Relevance:** Does your work align with the overall themes and values of the Fisher's Ghost Art Award?

Think about what makes your piece unique. Maybe it's the stunning pixel art reminiscent of classic games like *Chrono Trigger*, or perhaps a digital painting with a retro color palette inspired by the *Commodore 64*. Whatever it is, make sure it screams *you*!

### 3. Perfect Your Presentation

While your artwork is digital, presentation still matters. This might involve:

*   **High-resolution files:** Ensure your submitted files meet the required resolution and format specifications. Pixel art should be crisp and clear, not blurry!
*   **Printing (if required):** If the artwork is to be printed, ensure the colors are accurate, and the print quality is excellent. Consider the paper stock if printing is your responsibility.
*   **Framing (if required):** If applicable, choose a frame that complements your artwork and enhances its visual appeal.
*   **Clear Artist Statement:** The Artist Statement is incredibly important. This is your chance to give context, insight, and meaning to your work. Keep it concise, authentic, and compelling.

### 4. Consider Using the Right Tools

Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, the tools you use can significantly impact the quality of your work. Some popular software for digital artists include:

*   **Adobe Photoshop:** Industry-standard for digital painting and image editing.
*   **Clip Studio Paint:** Excellent for illustration, comics, and animation.
*   **Aseprite:** A fantastic choice for pixel art creation.
*   **Procreate (iPad):** A powerful and intuitive app for creating digital art on the go.

Experiment and find the tools that best suit your workflow and artistic style. And remember, it's not just the software – a good drawing tablet like a Wacom or Huion can also make a world of difference.
