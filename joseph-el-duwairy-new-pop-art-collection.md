### Influences and Inspirations

While officially described as Pop Art, Duwairy’s style seems to borrow elements from various sources. Imagine the boldness of classic Pop Art icons like Andy Warhol blended with the clean lines of mid-century modern design. There are even hints of retro gaming aesthetics lurking within the compositions, creating a uniquely compelling visual language.

Consider the vibrant color palettes reminiscent of early arcade games and the dynamic compositions that echo the fast-paced action of retro gaming consoles. It's a clever blend of the old and the new, appealing to both seasoned art aficionados and newcomers to the digital art world.
