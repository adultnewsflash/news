## FAQ About Pixel Art & Fan Art

### What is Pixel Art?

Pixel art is a form of digital art where images are created and edited at the pixel level. It's often associated with early video games and computers due to the limited resolutions available at the time. However, it remains a popular art form today, known for its simplicity, charm, and unique aesthetic.

### What Makes Good Pixel Art?

Good pixel art focuses on careful pixel placement, effective use of color palettes, and clear communication of the subject matter. It often involves clever use of dithering (creating gradients with pixel patterns) and anti-aliasing (smoothing out jagged edges) to enhance the visual appeal.
