# Exploring Art, War, and Memory: A Conversation with Jelena Petrović on Grupa Spomenik's "What Does War Stand for Today?"

War, memory, and the role of art in understanding complex social issues are weighty topics. Today, we delve into these themes through the lens of "What Does War Stand for Today?", an art-theory project by Grupa Spomenik (2010–12). This project, co-founded by Jelena Petrović, sparked conversations with Catherine Hass, Sami Khatib, and Milica Tomić, offering profound insights into the multifaceted relationship between conflict, remembrance, and artistic expression. Join us as we unpack the nuances of this impactful work.

## Unpacking "What Does War Stand for Today?"

"What Does War Stand for Today?" wasn't just a project; it was an investigation. Grupa Spomenik, with Jelena Petrović as a key figure, sought to explore the contemporary relevance and interpretation of war. The project, spanning from 2010 to 2012, adopted an art-theory approach, meaning it wasn't solely about creating aesthetically pleasing pieces, but rather using art as a tool for critical inquiry. Think of it as using pixels to dissect complex ideas, revealing hidden layers and fostering critical thinking.

### The Conversation Begins

The dialogue between Jelena Petrović, Catherine Hass, Sami Khatib, and Milica Tomić became crucial. Their individual perspectives, likely shaped by diverse backgrounds and experiences, helped to paint a broader picture of the project's themes. While specific details of their conversations are not provided in the prompt source, we can infer that the discussions centered around:

*   **The evolving meaning of war:** How has our understanding of war changed over time? What are the new forms and implications of contemporary conflicts?
*   **The role of memory:** How is war remembered, and who controls the narrative? How do art and artistic practices contribute to shaping collective memory?
*   **The power of art as a medium:** How can art be used to question, challenge, and ultimately transform our perceptions of war and its impact?

### Artistic Inquiry: More Than Just Aesthetics

The beauty of art-theory projects like this one lies in their ability to engage with complex issues in a way that traditional academic research might not. Art can bypass intellectual defenses, reaching audiences on an emotional level and prompting deeper reflection. The use of pixel art, for instance, could be a powerful way to explore themes of deconstruction and reconstruction in the context of war, mirroring the way conflicts break down societies and the subsequent attempts to rebuild them. Imagine fragmented pixelated images representing the aftermath of a conflict, inviting viewers to piece together a narrative of loss and resilience.

## Grupa Spomenik: More Than Just a Collective

Grupa Spomenik, co-founded by Jelena Petrović, is more than just a name. It's a testament to the power of collaborative artistic practice. By working together, artists can bring a wider range of skills, perspectives, and experiences to a project, resulting in a more nuanced and impactful outcome.

Projects like "What Does War Stand for Today?" highlight the crucial role of art in social commentary and historical reflection. They encourage us to question our assumptions, challenge established narratives, and ultimately, contribute to a more informed and empathetic understanding of the world around us. And this is what we as digital artists should also strive for.

## The Berlin Biennale Connection

Milica Tomić's involvement, as linked in the provided resource ([https://13.berlinbiennale.de/en/program/calendar/milica-tomic-what-does-the-name-of-war-stand-for-today-sequence-1](https://13.berlinbiennale.de/en/program/calendar/milica-tomic-what-does-the-name-of-war-stand-for-today-sequence-1)), places the project within the context of the Berlin Biennale, a major international art exhibition known for its politically engaged and thought-provoking programming. This context further emphasizes the project's ambition to engage with critical social and political issues on a global scale. It's like showcasing your pixel art game on a major platform; you're opening it up to a wider audience and a deeper level of scrutiny.

## Digital Art's Role in Remembering

How can digital art contribute to similar conversations? We have a wide range of tools at our disposal, from pixel art to digital illustration to interactive installations. We can create immersive experiences that transport viewers to different times and places, allowing them to connect with historical events on a visceral level. We can use generative art to explore the complexities of conflict and reconciliation. The possibilities are endless. As digital artists, we have a responsibility to use our creativity to engage with the world around us and contribute to meaningful dialogue.
