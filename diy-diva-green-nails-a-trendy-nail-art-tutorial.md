## Step-by-Step Tutorial: Achieve the Diva Green Look

Ready to transform your nails? Follow these simple steps for a flawless Diva Green manicure:

1.  **Prep Your Nails:** Start by removing any existing polish and shaping your nails to your desired length and style. Gently push back your cuticles and buff the surface of your nails for a smooth base.
2.  **Apply Base Coat:** Apply a thin, even layer of base coat to protect your nails.
3.  **Apply Diva Green Polish:** Apply one or two thin coats of your chosen Diva Green nail polish, allowing each coat to dry completely before applying the next. Thin coats prevent smudging and ensure even coverage.
4.  **Optional: Add Embellishments:** Now is the time to get creative! Use nail art brushes, dotting tools, or tape to add patterns, accents, or embellishments. Consider adding a touch of gold glitter for extra sparkle.
5.  **Apply Top Coat:** Once your design is dry, apply a generous layer of top coat to seal in the color and add shine.
6.  **Clean Up:** Use a small brush dipped in nail polish remover to clean up any mistakes around your cuticles.
7.  **Hydrate:** Finish by applying cuticle oil to keep your cuticles moisturized and healthy.

## Tips and Tricks for a Perfect Manicure

*   **Patience is Key:** Allow each coat of polish to dry completely before applying the next to avoid smudging.
*   **Thin Coats are Better:** Applying thin coats of polish results in a smoother, more even finish.
*   **Use a Quick-Drying Top Coat:** Speed up the drying process with a quick-drying top coat.
*   **Protect Your Work:** Wear gloves when doing chores to prevent chipping and damage.
