## Embracing the Retro Revolution

Pixel art is back in a big way, and for good reason! Its nostalgic charm and visual simplicity make it incredibly versatile. Geometric patterns, especially those with a neon glow, perfectly capture the energy of classic arcade games and 80s electronic music.

This is particularly useful for creating backgrounds for games, websites, or digital artwork.
