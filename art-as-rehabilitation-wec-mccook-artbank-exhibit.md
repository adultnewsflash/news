# Art as Rehabilitation: WEC's Inspiring Exhibit at McCook ArtBank

Art transcends boundaries, offering solace, expression, and even a path toward rehabilitation. Recently, the Work Ethic Camp (WEC) in Nebraska showcased the power of art through a powerful exhibit at the McCook ArtBank. Let's dive into this story of creativity, community, and the transformative potential of artistic expression.

## A Canvas for Change: WEC's Participation

The Nebraska Department of Correctional Services' Work Ethic Camp (WEC) provides a structured environment for individuals focused on rehabilitation and skill development. Art plays a pivotal role in this process, providing a creative outlet, fostering self-expression, and promoting positive change. The recent exhibit at the McCook ArtBank highlights the fruits of this labor, showcasing the artistic talents of individuals within the WEC program.

Unit Caseworker Wesley McCollam played a significant role in facilitating this collaboration, highlighting the dedication of individuals within the correctional system to support and promote rehabilitative programs.

Art therapy and creative expression offer numerous benefits within a rehabilitative context. These include:
