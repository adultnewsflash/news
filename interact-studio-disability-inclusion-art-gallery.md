# Interact Studio: A Celebration of Disability Inclusion in the Art World

Interact, a dynamic art studio supporting professional artists with disabilities, has just launched a brand new gallery space! This is a huge win for inclusivity in the art world and a testament to the incredible talent and perspectives these artists bring to the table. Let's dive into what this means for the creative community and how you can support this vital initiative.

## Breaking Barriers and Showcasing Talent

For too long, artists with disabilities have faced significant barriers to accessing the art world. Interact Studio is dedicated to dismantling those barriers, providing artists with the resources, support, and platform they need to thrive. Their newly launched gallery space isn't just a building; it's a beacon of hope, a place where creativity knows no bounds, and a testament to the power of inclusivity.

Brittany Kieler, Interact's gallery director, recently shared a sneak peek of the new space on CBS News. You can [watch the segment here](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/video/art-studio-for-professional-artists-with-disabilities-launches-new-gallery-space/) to get a visual sense of the vibrant artwork and welcoming atmosphere Interact provides. 

### The Importance of Representation

Representation matters. Seeing artists with disabilities celebrated and showcased in prominent gallery spaces sends a powerful message that everyone deserves a voice in the art world. This visibility not only empowers individual artists but also challenges societal perceptions and promotes a more inclusive and equitable creative landscape. Think of it as expanding the pixel palette of artistic expression â€“ the more colors and shades we include, the richer and more vibrant the overall picture becomes.
