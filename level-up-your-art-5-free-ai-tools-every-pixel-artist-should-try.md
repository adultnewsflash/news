## Integrating AI into Your Creative Workflow

Remember, these AI tools are meant to *augment* your creativity, not replace it. Experiment with different prompts, combine AI-generated images with your own artwork, and explore the boundaries of what's possible. Think of tools like Aseprite for refining AI outputs, or using them as inspiration for larger projects using tools like Procreate. Don't be afraid to push the limits and develop your own unique style.

## Tips for Effective AI Prompting

The key to unlocking the full potential of these tools is crafting effective prompts. Be specific, descriptive, and don't be afraid to experiment. Use keywords related to the style, subject matter, and desired mood of your artwork. For example, instead of "city," try "cyberpunk city with neon lights and flying cars." Also, consider specifying an art style such as "pixel art," or referencing famous pixel artists to steer the AI. 

## Conclusion: The Future of Pixel Art is Now

AI is changing the landscape of digital art, and these free tools offer a fantastic opportunity to explore its potential. By embracing these technologies, you can unlock new levels of creativity, streamline your workflow, and create truly unique and captivating pixel art.
