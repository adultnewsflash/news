# All Aboard! Tampere Tramway Opens Call for Artists â€“ A Chance to Pixel-ate Public Space!

Calling all pixel pushers, digital dabblers, and retro revivalists! A fantastic opportunity has rolled into town (or rather, *will* roll into town on a brand new tramway!) for artists to leave their mark on the city of Tampere, Finland. The Tampere-Pirkkala tramway project has announced its first call for artists, specifically for the Ruotula Tram stop. This is your chance to blend your unique creative vision with the everyday lives of the public.

## A Canvas on Rails: What's the Project About?

The city of Tampere is extending its tram network, connecting Pirkkala and Linnainmaa. As part of this exciting infrastructure development, the city is committed to integrating art into the public transportation experience. The first phase focuses on commissioning artwork for the Ruotula Tram stop, aiming to create a visually engaging and memorable space for commuters and residents alike. According to the official announcement at [www.tampere.fi](http://www.tampere.fi), this is a portfolio-based search, so get those digital portfolios ready!

## How Can Digital Artists Participate?

This isn't just for traditional painters and sculptors! Digital artists have a massive advantage in this kind of public art project. Think about the possibilities:

### Pixel Art Possibilities:

Imagine a large-scale mosaic created using pixel art principles! The tram stop could become a vibrant, retro-inspired landmark. Consider using software like Aseprite or Piskel to create eye-catching designs that translate well into a large-scale public art installation. You could even incorporate elements reminiscent of classic games like *Super Mario Bros.* or *The Secret of Monkey Island* (while respecting copyright, of course!).

### Digital Illustration & Projection:

Perhaps you envision a series of digital illustrations displayed on illuminated panels or projected onto surfaces within the tram stop. Think about creating artwork that responds to the changing seasons or the time of day, bringing a dynamic element to the space. Tools like Adobe Photoshop or Procreate would be essential for this approach.

### Retro-Inspired Design:

Tap into the nostalgia of retro aesthetics with designs that evoke the golden age of arcade games, 8-bit computers, or even vintage travel posters. Consider using vintage color palettes and typography to create a unique and timeless piece.

### Creative Tools & Techniques:

Don't be afraid to experiment with different digital techniques! Consider generative art, procedural textures, or even interactive installations that respond to the presence of people. Explore tools like Processing or TouchDesigner to bring a cutting-edge element to your proposal. Think about how your art can integrate into the architecture of the tram stop. Consider the materials that would be used to produce your art and how durable they are. This is Finland, after all, so consider weather conditions!

## Important Dates & Information

The call for artists officially started on August 19th (according to [www.tampere.fi](http://www.tampere.fi)).
