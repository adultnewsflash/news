## Step-by-Step Guide to Drawing Rudo

Here’s a simplified approach to drawing Rudo Surebrec. This tutorial is inspired by the helpful resources available at [https://linktr.ee/mcdrawanime](https://linktr.ee/mcdrawanime), especially the video guide located [here](https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://youtu.be/bY4FtdJI0hI&ct=ga&cd=CAEYACoUMTMxNjA3NTQwOTcwNDEyMjkzNTcyHTJhODZkNTc2NTJhMDQ3NWU6Y29tLnBoOmVuOlBI&usg=AOvVaw0ItmeTym9PvgWNRZEZPDwR).

### 1. Basic Shapes and Proportions

Start with basic shapes to map out the pose and proportions. Don’t worry about details at this stage. Focus on getting the overall structure right. Circles and rectangles are your friends here! Think about his action pose – is he running, standing, or in a combat stance? This foundational step is critical for a believable final result.

### 2. Refining the Sketch

Now, begin to refine the sketch. Add more detail to the face, body, and clothing. Focus on defining his facial features, like his eyes and hairstyle. Pay attention to the angles and proportions we discussed earlier. Remember to keep the lines light and erasable, as you'll be refining further.

### 3. Line Art

Once you’re happy with the sketch, it's time to create the line art. Use a darker, more defined line to trace over the sketch. Varying the line weight can add depth and visual interest. For example, thicker lines can be used for outlines and areas in shadow, while thinner lines can be used for details and highlights. Many digital artists on CreativePixelVibe.art use programs like Aseprite or Procreate for their line art; both offer fantastic brush control.

### 4. Coloring and Shading

Next up is coloring! Use flat colors to fill in the base tones. Then, add shading to create depth and dimension. Consider the light source and how it affects the shadows. Experiment with different shading techniques, such as cell shading or soft shading. Digital tools like Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint offer extensive color palettes and shading options.

### 5. Adding Details and Highlights

Finally, add details and highlights to bring your Rudo drawing to life! Focus on adding small details to the clothing, hair, and face. Highlights can be added to areas where light is hitting the surface. This step is where you can really inject your own style and flair. Don't be afraid to experiment!
