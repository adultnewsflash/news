## What's the LazerDim700 Vibe?

### A Nod to Retro Influences?

While distinctly modern, there are subtle nods to retro art styles embedded within LazerDim700's work. The bold line art and simplified shapes can be seen as echoing elements of 90s comics or even the character designs of early video games. This retro sensibility might be contributing to the art's widespread appeal, tapping into a sense of nostalgia alongside its contemporary edge.

*   **Master Line Weight:** Varying the thickness of your lines can add depth and dimension to your art. Use thicker lines for outlines and thinner lines for details.
*   **Experiment with Color:** Explore high-contrast color combinations to create visually striking compositions. Consider using complementary colors or limited palettes for a more cohesive look.
*   **Digital Tools of the Trade:** While LazerDim700's specific tools aren't explicitly mentioned, most digital artists leverage software like Adobe Photoshop, Procreate (popular on iPad), or free alternatives like Krita for their work. Don't underestimate the power of a good stylus! The Apple Pencil or Wacom tablets are fantastic options for digital drawing.
