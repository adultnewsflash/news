# Supercars and Pizza Hut Serve Up AR Racing Fun with 'Mount Pizzarama' at Bathurst 1000

Get ready to rev your engines and grab a slice! Supercars and Pizza Hut have teamed up to launch 'Mount Pizzarama,' an augmented reality (AR) racing game coinciding with the Bathurst 1000. Forget photorealistic graphics; this is early, evolving AI art at its finest, bringing a unique visual style to the racing experience. Let's dive into this exciting intersection of racing, pizza, and AR innovation!

## What is 'Mount Pizzarama'?

'Mount Pizzarama' isn't your typical ultra-realistic racing sim. Think more along the lines of charmingly stylized visuals, perhaps reminiscent of low-poly or voxel art, infused with that distinctive AI art flair. Imagine the iconic Bathurst track transformed into a playful, slightly surreal landscape, complete with Pizza Hut-themed elements scattered throughout. 

According to a report on Mi3, fans can participate in this AR race from the comfort of their homes. This suggests a mobile-based experience, allowing users to overlay the racing action onto their real-world environment via their smartphone or tablet cameras. It's a fun and accessible way to engage with the Bathurst 1000 event, even if you can't be there in person.

## The Art Style: Embracing the AI Aesthetic

While details are limited, the mention of "early and evolving AI art" suggests a less polished, more experimental visual style. This could mean unexpected textures, slightly distorted perspectives, or abstract representations of familiar racing elements. It might evoke a feeling similar to early procedural generation or even the charmingly imperfect aesthetics of the Playstation 1 era, but with a modern AI twist. This choice moves away from the pursuit of photorealism that dominates much of the gaming landscape, offering a refreshing and potentially very meme-able alternative.

Think of it as a digital art experiment that happens to be a racing game. It's an interesting direction that may signal a shift towards accepting and embracing AI-generated art's inherent imperfections and unique characteristics.

### Inspiration from Retro Gaming and Low-Poly Art

Artists looking for inspiration for similar projects might consider exploring:

*   **PS1 Graphics:** The blocky, textured look of PlayStation 1 games offers a wealth of visual ideas. Games like *Ridge Racer* or *Gran Turismo* could be aesthetic starting points.
*   **Low-Poly Art:** This style focuses on creating 3D models with a minimal number of polygons, resulting in a sharp, geometric aesthetic. Consider artists like Timothy J. Reynolds (@TimothyJReynolds on Twitter) for inspiration.
*   **Voxel Art:** Similar to low-poly art, voxel art uses cube-shaped pixels to create 3D models. *Minecraft* is the most famous example, but there are many talented voxel artists creating incredible work. Check out @SirCarma on Twitter for great examples.

## Why This Matters for Digital Artists

'Mount Pizzarama' highlights a few key trends relevant to digital artists:

*   **AR Integration:** Augmented reality is becoming increasingly accessible, opening up new avenues for interactive art experiences.
*   **AI-Assisted Art:** AI tools are increasingly being used to generate textures, models, and even entire game worlds. Understanding these tools and how to integrate them into your workflow is becoming essential.
*   **Embracing Imperfection:** The emphasis on "early and evolving AI art" signals a shift towards accepting and celebrating the unique qualities of AI-generated content, even its flaws. This is a refreshing change from the relentless pursuit of photorealism.

## Getting Involved

As the Bathurst 1000 approaches, keep an eye out for more details on how to access and play 'Mount Pizzarama.' This could be a great opportunity to experience the future of AR gaming and appreciate the evolving landscape of AI-assisted art.

Unfortunately, that detail hasn't been released yet, but given the AR aspect, it's highly likely it will be a mobile game available on iOS and Android.

**Q: Is 'Mount Pizzarama' free to play?**

Again, this hasn't been confirmed. However, given its promotional nature alongside Pizza Hut and the Bathurst 1000, it's likely to be a free-to-play experience, possibly with in-app purchases.

**Q: What kind of art style can I expect from the game?**

Expect a more stylized, less photorealistic look. The description emphasizes "early and evolving AI art", so think charmingly imperfect and potentially a bit abstract, perhaps drawing inspiration from retro gaming aesthetics or low-poly art styles.
