## What is the OASis Residency?

The OASis Residency, organized by the Today Art Initiative, is a unique program designed to provide international artists with a platform to create, connect, and explore. The 2025 edition will be held in Armenia, offering a rich tapestry of history, culture, and natural beauty as a backdrop for artistic exploration. Imagine finding inspiration in the ancient architecture, vibrant markets, and breathtaking landscapes â€“ a true feast for the creative soul!

## Why Armenia? A Pixel Artist's Paradise

Armenia, a land steeped in history and brimming with cultural treasures, offers a unique experience for artists. Think of the possibilities:

*   **Ancient Inspiration:** Draw inspiration from the intricate stone carvings, ancient monasteries, and the legacy of Armenian art. These elements can easily translate into captivating pixel art textures, compelling character designs, or the retro aesthetic often found in isometric adventure games.
*   **Cultural Immersion:** Immerse yourself in the vibrant local culture, interact with fellow artists, and experience the warmth of Armenian hospitality. This cross-cultural exchange can significantly influence your creative vision.
*   **Landscape as Muse:** The diverse landscapes, from the majestic Mount Ararat (though technically in Turkey now) to the serene Lake Sevan, provide endless visual stimuli. Imagine capturing the subtle color palettes of the Armenian highlands in your next 16-bit masterpiece.

## What to Expect from the Residency

Although details might evolve with the official announcement, artist residencies generally offer the following:

*   **Dedicated Studio Space:** A comfortable and functional workspace is essential for creative production. Expect a designated area where you can focus on your art, experiment with new techniques, or perfect your pixel art skills.
*   **Accommodation:** Living expenses can be a significant burden, so having accommodation provided as part of the residency allows you to focus entirely on your artistic development.
*   **Exhibition/Presentation Opportunities:** Many residencies culminate in an exhibition or presentation of the work created during the program. This provides a valuable opportunity to showcase your art, receive feedback, and connect with a wider audience.
*   **Networking Opportunities:** Connecting with fellow artists, curators, and art professionals can open doors to future collaborations and opportunities. Residencies often facilitate networking events and workshops.
