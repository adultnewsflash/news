Local news source The Suburban Times recently announced Mari Griffin as Tacoma's Poet Laureate for the years 2025-2027.

## Finding Inspiration in Poetry for Pixel Art

So, how can a poet laureate's appointment inspire *you*, the digital artist? Let's explore a few avenues:

### 1. Storytelling and Narrative

Poetry, at its heart, is about storytelling. Consider how you can incorporate narrative elements into your pixel art. Instead of simply creating a visually appealing scene, think about the story behind it. Who are the characters? What are they doing? What world do they inhabit? Griffin's work, focused on connection and community, can inspire you to create pieces that tell stories of unity, resilience, and hope. Think beyond the visual and embrace the power of narrative, perhaps even pairing your art with a short poem or caption.

### 2. Symbolism and Metaphor

Poets often use symbolism and metaphor to convey deeper meanings. Challenge yourself to do the same in your digital art. A simple object, carefully placed, can represent a complex idea. Think about the colors you use and the emotions they evoke. For example, a pixel art forest can symbolize growth and potential, while a retro-style arcade game can represent nostalgia and the passage of time. Explore how Griffin's poetry uses symbolism and find ways to translate those concepts into visual form.

### 3. Community and Connection

Griffin's dedication to community is a powerful reminder that art can be a force for positive change. Consider creating pixel art or digital illustrations that celebrate your community. Showcase local landmarks, depict everyday heroes, or create pieces that raise awareness about important social issues. Let Griffin's commitment to bridging worlds inspire you to use your art to connect with others and make a difference.

### 4. Experimenting with Retro Aesthetics

While not directly related to Griffin's appointment, exploring retro aesthetics can be a fun way to connect with the past and create art that resonates with a wide audience. Consider using tools like Aseprite or Procreate to create pixel art inspired by classic video games. You can even combine retro styles with modern themes, creating a unique and thought-provoking visual experience. Think about how you can use these tools to bring your own stories to life, inspired by the themes of community and connection that Griffin champions.

## Beyond Pixel Art: Inspiration for All Digital Artists

The principles of storytelling, symbolism, and community connection apply to all forms of digital art. Whether you're a digital illustrator, a 3D modeler, or a motion graphics designer, consider how you can incorporate these elements into your work. Mari Griffin's appointment as Tacoma's Poet Laureate is a reminder that art is a powerful tool for communication, connection, and change. Let it inspire you to create art that is not only visually stunning but also meaningful and impactful.
