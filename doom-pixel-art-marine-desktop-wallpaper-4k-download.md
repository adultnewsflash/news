## The Enduring Appeal of Doom and Pixel Art

Doom, released in 1993, revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. Its fast-paced action, demonic enemies, and heavy metal soundtrack made it an instant classic. Even today, it continues to inspire game developers and artists alike. Games like *Project Warlock* or *Ion Fury* follow the same retro FPS style of Doom and are very popular with pixel art fans.

Pixel art, on the other hand, has experienced a resurgence in recent years. Its simplicity and charm appeal to artists and gamers alike. The limitations of the medium encourage creativity and resourcefulness, resulting in visually striking and memorable artwork. The community around pixel art is thriving, with talented artists like [eBoy](https://hello.eboy.com/) and [Henk Nieborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henk_Nieborg) pushing the boundaries of the art form.
