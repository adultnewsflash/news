## FAQ

### What exactly is "Abstract AI Art"?

Abstract AI art refers to artworks created using artificial intelligence algorithms. These algorithms can generate images, patterns, and compositions that are often non-representational and open to interpretation, influenced by user prompts and the AI's training data.

### Are these figures durable?

The Amazon UK listing specifies they are designed for collectors and should be handled with care. Specific materials and durability information would be found on the product page itself.

### Are these figures suitable for children?

Given their collectible nature and potential for small parts, it's best to treat these as art objects for display rather than toys for young children. Always check the specific product details on Amazon for age recommendations.
