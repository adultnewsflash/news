# Jeff Poe on Art, Mistakes, and a Bold New Creative Horizon

**An L.A. art world veteran reflects on the past, present, and future of art – and hints at a fresh endeavor that's got the creative community buzzing.**

In a recent interview with Artnet News, storied Los Angeles art dealer Jeff Poe opens up about his experiences in the art market, some of the industry's missteps, and his exciting new venture. We dive into the key takeaways from this insightful conversation and explore how these reflections might resonate with digital artists and the broader creative community.

## A Look Back at the Art Market

Jeff Poe, known for his keen eye and influence in the Los Angeles art scene, doesn't shy away from discussing the evolution – and perhaps, some would say, devolution – of the art market. His retrospective offers a valuable perspective on what has worked, what hasn't, and the lessons learned along the way.

### The Rise of Speculation

Poe points to the increasing role of speculation in the art market. While recognizing that a degree of investment is inherent, he expresses concern about art becoming primarily a financial asset, potentially overshadowing the artistic merit itself. This trend can be particularly disheartening for emerging artists striving to break through in a scene increasingly dominated by high-value works and established names.

### The Democratization of Art (Sort Of…)

While the digital age has ostensibly democratized art through online platforms and social media, Poe suggests there’s a complex interplay at play. The accessibility and exposure are undeniable benefits, allowing artists to reach wider audiences. However, it also creates an incredibly crowded field, making it challenging to stand out and build a sustainable career. The algorithm becomes a gatekeeper in its own right, potentially favoring trends over genuine artistic innovation.

## A Glimpse Into the Future: Poe's New Venture

Intriguingly, the interview alludes to a new project Poe is undertaking. While details remain scarce, the anticipation is palpable. He hints at a venture that's deeply connected to the art world but seems to represent a departure from the traditional gallery model. 

### Implications for Digital Artists

So, what does this mean for pixel artists, digital illustrators, and creatives working in retro styles? Poe's project could represent a shift towards a more artist-centric approach, potentially creating new opportunities for showcasing and selling digital art. Imagine a platform that prioritizes artistic vision over hype, providing a curated space for discovering and supporting unique digital creations.

Whether his new endeavor will fully embrace the digital art space is still unknown, but it sparks imagination and possibilities. Perhaps it will feature collaborations with platforms like ArtStation or Foundation, two popular spaces for digital artists to showcase and sell their work. It would be amazing to see his influence and expertise brought to the burgeoning world of NFT art and digital collectibles in general.
