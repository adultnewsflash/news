Use tools like Adobe Color to help refine your palette choices.
*   **Brushwork and Texture:** Study the brushstrokes and textures created by the artists. In digital painting software like Procreate or Photoshop, experiment with different brush settings to mimic the look and feel of oil or acrylic paint.
*   **Composition:** Analyze the composition of the artworks. Notice how the artists use the rule of thirds, leading lines, and negative space to create visually appealing and balanced compositions. Apply these principles to your own digital creations.
