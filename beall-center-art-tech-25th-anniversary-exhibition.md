*   **New techniques and tools:** Exposure to innovative art can introduce you to new techniques and tools you might not have considered. Maybe an interactive installation gives you ideas for implementing user input in your pixel art games.
*   **Conceptual inspiration:** Seeing how artists are exploring themes like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality can spark new conceptual ideas for your work. What stories can you tell through the lens of pixel art and retro aesthetics?
*   **A broader perspective:** The Beall Center's exhibition provides a wider perspective on the role of technology in art, helping you to contextualize your own work within the larger creative landscape.

## Connecting with the Spirit of Innovation

The Beall Centerâ€™s work resonates with the ethos of classic games and retro-style art. Think of the early days of video games, when limited technology fueled incredible creativity. Games like *The Legend of Zelda* on the NES and LucasArts' *Monkey Island* series, while constrained by the technology of their time, became masterpieces of storytelling and visual design. The Beall Center fosters that same spirit of innovation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the tools available.

Many contemporary tools used by digital artists, such as Aseprite for pixel art creation and programs like Krita for digital painting, are constantly evolving. By attending exhibitions like the Beall Center's 25th anniversary show, you'll gain invaluable insights into the future of digital art and the role of technology in creative expression.
