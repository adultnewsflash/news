### Digital Painting: Mastering the Realistic Approach

For those inspired by ghneer_'s detailed style, digital painting is the way to go. Here's what you'll need:

*   **Software:** Photoshop, Procreate (for iPad), Clip Studio Paint are all excellent choices.
*   **Tablet:** A graphics tablet with pressure sensitivity is crucial for achieving nuanced shading and line work. Wacom and Huion are popular brands.

Consider exploring the work of artists like Craig Mullins or Even Amundsen for inspiration. Their mastery of light and form will provide a great starting point.

### Pixel Art: A Retro Twist

Prefer a more retro look? Pixel art can be a fantastic way to depict knights. Think classic games like *Castlevania* or *Final Fantasy*.

*   **Software:** Aseprite is a dedicated pixel art editor, but you can also use Photoshop or even free options like Piskel.
*   **Constraints:** Pixel art is all about working within limitations. Each pixel counts! Experiment with color palettes and limited resolutions.

### Stylized Illustration: Finding Your Unique Voice

Don't feel confined to realism or retro aesthetics. Embrace a stylized approach! Experiment with bold colors, simplified shapes, and unique line work. Think about artists like Loish or Pascal Campion, who have developed distinct and recognizable styles.

*   **Software:** Any digital illustration software will work, but focus on finding brushes and techniques that support your chosen style.
*   **Experimentation:** Don't be afraid to try new things! Play with different color palettes, brush textures, and composition techniques.
*   **Inspiration:** Look beyond traditional fantasy art. Draw inspiration from comics, animation, or even abstract art.
