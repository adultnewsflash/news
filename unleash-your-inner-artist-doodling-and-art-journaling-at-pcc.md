**Ever felt the urge to create, but didn't know where to start? Art journaling, fueled by the simple act of doodling, might be the perfect outlet for you. And guess what? Portland Community College (PCC) is offering a class that dives deep into the creative possibilities!**

This article explores the power of art journaling and doodling, offering insights and inspiration for aspiring artists. We'll also highlight the exciting opportunity to learn these techniques formally at PCC.

## The Magic of Art Journaling

Art journaling is more than just scribbling in a notebook. It's a personalized visual diary, a space to explore emotions, document experiences, and simply let your creativity flow without judgment. Think of it as a visual playground where you can experiment with different mediums, techniques, and ideas. No rules, just pure creative expression!

### Why Keep an Art Journal?

*   **Stress Relief:** Doodling and journaling can be incredibly therapeutic, helping to calm your mind and reduce stress.
*   **Creative Exploration:** It's a safe space to experiment with different art styles and techniques without the pressure of perfection.
*   **Self-Discovery:** Art journaling can help you process your thoughts and feelings, leading to greater self-awareness.
*   **Improved Art Skills:** Regular practice, even through simple doodles, can significantly improve your artistic skills over time.

## Doodling: The Foundation of Creativity

Doodling is often dismissed as mindless scribbling, but it's actually a powerful creative tool. It can unlock your imagination, improve your focus, and even help you solve problems.

### Doodling Techniques to Try

*   **Zentangle:** This structured form of doodling involves creating intricate patterns within defined shapes. Resources like Zentangle.com offer guidance and inspiration.
*   **Organic Doodling:** Let your pen wander freely across the page, creating abstract shapes and lines. Focus on the process rather than the outcome.
*   **Character Doodling:** Create simple characters or creatures using basic shapes. Experiment with different expressions and poses.
*   **Pattern Doodling:** Explore repetitive patterns and textures. Think about geometric shapes, floral motifs, or abstract designs.

### Tools of the Trade

While you can doodle with just a pen and paper, experimenting with different tools can add variety and interest to your art journal:

*   **Pens:** Fine-liners, brush pens, gel pens, and colored pencils are all great options.
*   **Markers:** Alcohol-based markers like Copic markers are popular for their blendability, while water-based markers are more forgiving.
*   **Pencils:** Graphite pencils offer a wide range of tones, while colored pencils add vibrant hues.
*   **Paper:** Choose a journal with thick, acid-free paper that can handle a variety of mediums. Moleskine art journals are a popular choice.
*   **Digital Tools:** Consider using apps like Procreate on your iPad for a digital art journaling experience.
