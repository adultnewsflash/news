Billie's contributions directly impact the quality of education at USU. Her endowment allows the College of Arts to attract top-tier faculty, provide scholarships to deserving students, and develop innovative programs that equip aspiring teachers with the latest pedagogical techniques.

### Elevating the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art

Beyond the classroom, Billie understands the importance of accessible art experiences. Her major gift to the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art helps to preserve its collection, expand its outreach programs, and create engaging exhibitions that inspire students and the broader community. Museums are vital spaces for learning and inspiration. Think of the impact a visit to see a meticulously crafted pixel art animation exhibit could have on a young student!

## The Importance of Inspired Art Education

In an increasingly digital world, the role of art education is more critical than ever. It fosters creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and emotional intelligence – qualities that are essential for success in any field. Inspired art educators, like those being nurtured at USU, are equipped to cultivate these skills in their students, empowering them to become innovative thinkers and creative problem-solvers.

### Embracing Digital Art in the Classroom

Modern art education isn't just about traditional mediums like painting and sculpture. It's about embracing digital art forms like pixel art, digital illustration, animation, and game design. Educators trained at USU, thanks to Billie's support, are at the forefront of this movement, integrating tools like Procreate, Photoshop, and Blender into their curricula. They're teaching students to express themselves creatively in a digital age.

### Finding Inspiration in Retro Aesthetics

The resurgence of retro art styles provides a wealth of inspiration for art educators. From the 8-bit charm of classic video games to the vibrant colors of vintage posters, these aesthetics offer a unique lens through which to explore design principles, color theory, and visual storytelling. Educators are incorporating these elements into their lessons, sparking creativity and connecting students to a rich artistic heritage. One could even task students with recreating famous paintings in pixel art.
