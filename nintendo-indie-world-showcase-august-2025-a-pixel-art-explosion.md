## Neverway: A Pixel Art Masterpiece

Without a doubt, the game generating the most buzz within the pixel art community is **Neverway**, announced with a tentative release window of 2026. From the trailer showcased, Neverway seems to be an action-adventure game, utilizing detailed pixel graphics reminiscent of titles like *Blasphemous* or *Moonscars*. The art style is incredibly refined, with fluid animations and a dark, compelling atmosphere. It's a game that clearly demonstrates the incredible heights pixel art can achieve with dedication and talent.

### Why Neverway Has Us Hyped

## Other Notable Announcements

While Neverway stole the show for many pixel art enthusiasts, several other titles also deserve a mention:
