# Level Up Your Isometric Art with Pixel_Salvaje's 64x64 Character Template

Are you diving into the world of isometric pixel art and searching for the perfect starting point? Look no further! @pixel_Salvaje on Twitter (and Itch.io) has gifted the pixel art community with a fantastic 64x64 isometric character template that’s perfect for beginners and seasoned artists alike. Let's explore why this template is a game-changer and how you can use it to create stunning isometric characters.

## What Makes This Template So Special?

This isn't just another pixel art template. @pixel_Salvaje's creation offers a solid foundation for building captivating isometric characters, especially within the popular 64x64 pixel size. Here's what makes it stand out:

*   **Isometric Perspective Made Easy:** Isometric art can be tricky, especially when visualizing angles and proportions. This template provides a pre-defined isometric grid and basic character shape, removing the guesswork and allowing you to focus on design.
*   **Optimized for 64x64 Canvas:** The 64x64 resolution is a sweet spot for pixel art. It's large enough to include detail but small enough to retain that classic, retro feel, reminiscent of games like *Landstalker* or *Diablo II* (when viewed with scaling techniques).
*   **Versatility:** While the template provides a base, the possibilities are endless! You can customize the character's clothing, features, and accessories to create a diverse cast of characters for your projects.
*   **Free Resource:** The best part? It's a free resource available on @pixel_Salvaje's Itch.io page! This makes it incredibly accessible for artists of all skill levels.

### Where to Find the Template

You can grab the template directly from [pixel_Salvaje's Itch.io page](https://pixel-salvaje.itch.io/isometric-character-template-64-pixel-art). Be sure to show your appreciation to the artist by following them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pixel_Salvaje) and leaving a rating or comment on their Itch.io page.

## Getting Started with the Template

Once you've downloaded the template, here’s how to make the most of it:

1.  **Choose Your Pixel Art Software:** Most pixel art programs will work. Popular choices include Aseprite, Pyxel Edit, Piskel, and even free options like GIMP with appropriate plugins.
2.  **Import the Template:** Open the template file in your chosen software. Usually, it comes in a standard image format like PNG.
3.  **Create a New Layer:** Always work on a new layer *above* the template. This allows you to easily toggle the template's visibility and avoid accidentally editing it directly.
4.  **Start Designing!** Use the template as a guide to create your character's features, clothing, and accessories. Experiment with different color palettes and shading techniques.
5.  **Animate (Optional):** @pixel_Salvaje mentions it's suitable for animation! Once you have your base character, consider creating animation frames for walking, running, or other actions.  This is where you'll truly see your character come to life.

## Tips for Creating Stunning Isometric Pixel Art

*   **Master the Isometric Grid:** Understanding the isometric grid is crucial. Practice drawing simple shapes in isometric perspective to get a feel for the angles.
*   **Color Palette is Key:** Limit your color palette to a small number of carefully chosen colors. This helps maintain visual consistency and creates a more polished look. Websites like Coolors or Adobe Color can help you find pleasing palettes.
*   **Experiment with Shading:** Shading adds depth and dimension to your characters. Consider the light source and use darker shades on the opposite side to create a sense of form.
*   **Practice Makes Perfect:** Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes! The more you practice, the better you'll become at creating isometric pixel art. Look at other artists using hashtags such as #pixelart and #isometric on Twitter for inspiration.
