# Oglethorpe Students Uncover New Art Appreciation as Museum Gallery Assistants

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be on the other side of the canvas, helping to curate and showcase the art that inspires us all? For two studio art students at Oglethorpe University, Eloa Noir and Gabriela Dumar Jarava, that dream became a reality. Their experience as gallery assistants at the Oglethorpe University Museum of Art (OUMA) has given them a fresh perspective and a deeper connection to the world of art. Let's dive into their journey and explore how this unique opportunity is shaping their artistic growth.

## A New Perspective on Art

Working within a museum setting provides an invaluable experience for aspiring artists. It's more than just viewing art; it's understanding the processes behind exhibitions, from installation and conservation to engaging with visitors. Eloa and Gabriela’s experience demonstrates the value of hands-on learning within the art world. 

### Behind the Scenes at OUMA

Eloa and Gabriela haven't just been observing – they've been actively involved! Their roles as gallery assistants have immersed them in the practicalities of running a museum. Tasks like preparing exhibition spaces, assisting with art handling, and interacting with the public offer a unique insight into the art ecosystem. This direct involvement fosters a profound appreciation for the work that goes into preserving and presenting art for the enjoyment of others.

### The Impact on Artistic Growth

This isn't just a job; it's an education. Working at OUMA has broadened Eloa and Gabriela’s understanding of different artistic styles, techniques, and historical contexts. Exposure to a diverse collection of artwork helps fuel creativity and inform their own artistic practice. Observing visitor reactions to artwork also offers valuable feedback, allowing them to see their own work through new eyes. Such experience can lead artists to experiment with new approaches and develop a stronger voice in their own creations.

## Connecting with the Art Community

Beyond the practical skills and artistic insights, this experience has fostered a stronger connection with the art community. Eloa and Gabriela are now part of a network of artists, curators, and art enthusiasts. These connections can be invaluable for future collaborations, mentorship opportunities, and career advancement within the art world.

Imagine if you could get a similar opportunity in pixel art or retro gaming museums! These experiences can inspire us all, regardless of our specific artistic field.

## The Value of Experiential Learning in Art

This experience underscores the importance of experiential learning in art education. While traditional classroom instruction is essential, hands-on opportunities like museum internships provide a crucial link between theory and practice. Such experiences allow students to apply their knowledge in real-world settings, develop critical thinking skills, and gain a deeper understanding of the art world.

For digital artists, imagine the value of interning at a gallery showcasing pixel art, a place like iam8bit or similar showcases. This exposure could inspire new techniques and a greater appreciation for the craft.

## Inspired to Engage?

Eloa and Gabriela's experience should encourage aspiring artists to seek out similar opportunities. Whether it's volunteering at a local art gallery, interning at a museum, or participating in community art projects, actively engaging with the art world can significantly enhance your artistic growth and career prospects.

So, what are you waiting for? Explore the art scene around you and discover the hidden treasures that await. Perhaps, you'll find your next inspiration just like Eloa and Gabriela did!
