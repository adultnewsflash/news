# UB Art Galleries Kick Off Season with Must-See Digital Art Exhibitions!

Get ready, art lovers! The University at Buffalo Art Galleries are starting the academic year with a bang, featuring exhibitions that are sure to capture the attention of pixel art enthusiasts, digital illustrators, and retro gaming fans alike. The Center for the Arts (CFA) Gallery is the place to be, and CreativePixelVibe.art has the scoop!

## Immersive Digital Experiences Await

The UB Art Galleries are committed to showcasing diverse and thought-provoking art. This season's exhibitions promise a captivating blend of contemporary and innovative digital art forms. While specifics about the exhibitions are under wraps (stay tuned for more!), we can expect works that push the boundaries of digital creation and explore themes relevant to our increasingly digital world.

### Pixel Art Takes Center Stage?

We're hoping (and predicting!) that pixel art will have a prominent presence. Imagine experiencing large-scale pixel art installations, interactive pixel games, or even digital paintings that mimic the nostalgic charm of classic 8-bit aesthetics. The potential is huge!

### Digital Illustration and Retro Vibes

Beyond pixel art, we anticipate seeing stunning examples of digital illustration. Think vibrant character designs, intricate environment paintings, and maybe even a nod to retro art styles reminiscent of vintage arcade games or early computer graphics. Perhaps artists will be utilizing tools like [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) or incorporating techniques inspired by legendary artists like [Paul Robertson](https://probertson.net/).
