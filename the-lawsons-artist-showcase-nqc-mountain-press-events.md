*   **Support the Arts:** Attending art events shows support for the creative community, which is always a good thing!

It would be worthwhile to investigate before attending to see if their work aligns with your personal interests. Perhaps their art style has a retro vibe that compliments pixel art. If you are in the area, you may as well investigate!
