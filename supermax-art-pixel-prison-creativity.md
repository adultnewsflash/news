# Art Behind Bars: How Supermax Inmates are Finding Freedom Through Pixel Art

Imagine finding solace and creative expression in the most unlikely of places: a Supermax prison. That's exactly what's happening in Colorado, where inmates, including the infamous Terry Nichols, are producing and selling artwork, including pieces that delve into the captivating world of pixel art. This initiative, documented by The Colorado Sun, is transforming lives and challenging perceptions about art and rehabilitation.

## A Creative Outlet in Confinement

For those confined within the walls of a Supermax prison, opportunities for self-expression are incredibly limited. The Colorado Department of Corrections, recognizing the therapeutic and rehabilitative power of art, has fostered a program allowing inmates to create and sell their work. This provides them with a sense of purpose, a connection to the outside world, and even a small income.

### Beyond the Canvas: Exploring Digital Art

While traditional mediums like painting and drawing are prevalent, digital art, including pixel art, is also emerging as a popular avenue for creative exploration within the prison system. The simple, accessible nature of pixel art makes it an ideal medium for those with limited resources and access to sophisticated tools. Imagine creating intricate designs, reminiscent of classic 8-bit games like *The Legend of Zelda* or *Super Mario Bros.*, using just basic software and a lot of imagination!

### Terry Nichols: From Infamy to Artistry

The Colorado Sun article highlights the participation of Terry Nichols, one of the individuals convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing. His involvement in the art program is a complex and controversial topic. While some may find it difficult to reconcile his past with his present artistic endeavors, others see it as an opportunity for him to engage in a constructive activity and potentially contribute positively to society. Regardless of individual perspectives, Nichols' participation underscores the program's reach and its potential to impact even the most hardened individuals.

## The Impact of Prison Art Programs

Art programs in prisons offer a range of benefits, both for the inmates themselves and for society as a whole.

### Rehabilitation and Self-Discovery

Creating art can be a deeply therapeutic process, allowing inmates to process their emotions, explore their identities, and develop a sense of self-worth. It can also provide them with valuable skills, such as patience, discipline, and attention to detail, which can be beneficial upon their release.

### Connecting with the Outside World

Selling artwork allows inmates to connect with the outside world in a meaningful way. It provides them with a sense of validation and recognition, and it can help them to rebuild their lives and relationships.

### Challenging Perceptions

Art created by incarcerated individuals can challenge societal perceptions about crime and punishment. It can humanize those who are often demonized and provide a platform for them to share their stories and perspectives.

## The Future of Art in Corrections

The success of the Colorado program demonstrates the potential of art to transform lives and contribute to rehabilitation within the prison system. As digital art and pixel art continue to gain popularity, it is likely that more inmates will explore these mediums as a means of self-expression and connection.

It's exciting to imagine inmates using tools like Aseprite or Piskel to create stunning pixel art pieces that rival those found in indie games or online art communities. The potential is there, and with continued support and resources, prison art programs can play an even greater role in fostering rehabilitation and promoting positive change.
