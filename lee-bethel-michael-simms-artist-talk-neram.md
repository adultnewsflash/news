Discover their creative processes, inspirations, and contributions to the contemporary art scene. This article is for all the digital art lovers out there who are excited by the creative work of other artists in more conventional mediums.

## A Meeting of Artistic Minds

The New England Regional Art Museum (NERAM) recently hosted a fascinating artist talk featuring Lee Bethel and Michael Simms, two artists with distinct voices and perspectives. The event was moderated by esteemed figures in the art world: Dr. Philip Bacon AM, Director of Philip Bacon Galleries, and Mr. Barry Pearce AM, Emeritus Curator of the Art Gallery of NSW. Supported by Create NSW - Arts, this talk offered a valuable opportunity to delve into the artists' practices and explore the themes driving their work.

### Lee Bethel: A Journey in Texture and Form

Lee Bethel's work often explores the intersection of texture, form, and space. Her pieces are known for their tactile quality, inviting viewers to engage with the artwork on a sensory level. The NERAM talk likely touched upon her techniques for creating these captivating textures, perhaps discussing the materials she uses and the processes she employs. For digital artists, understanding how traditional artists like Bethel manipulate physical materials can provide inspiration for creating compelling digital textures using tools like Procreate or Adobe Photoshop.

### Michael Simms: Narrative and Abstraction

Michael Simms' art blends narrative elements with abstract forms. His paintings often hint at stories and emotions, leaving room for interpretation and personal connection. During the artist talk, Simms may have shed light on the narrative threads that weave through his work and the symbolism he incorporates. For digital illustrators working on character design or storytelling, insights into Simms' approach can be valuable for enhancing the emotional depth and visual intrigue of their creations.

## Insights for Digital Artists

While Bethel and Simms primarily work in traditional mediums, their insights are incredibly relevant to digital artists. Here are some key takeaways:

*   **Understanding Materiality:** Even in the digital realm, understanding the properties of materials is crucial. Consider how different brushes, textures, and filters can simulate the effects of paint, ink, or clay.
*   **Narrative Depth:** Whether you're creating pixel art characters or detailed digital paintings, think about the stories you want to tell. Consider the emotions you want to evoke and how you can use visual cues to convey them.
*   **Composition and Space:** How you arrange elements within your artwork can significantly impact its overall effect. Study the compositions of Bethel and Simms to see how they use space to guide the viewer's eye and create visual interest.
*   **The Power of Abstraction:** Don't be afraid to experiment with abstract forms and textures. Abstraction can add depth and complexity to your work, allowing viewers to interpret your art in their own way. Think of the creative world of generative art!

## Connecting with the Art World

The NERAM artist talk highlights the importance of engaging with the broader art world, regardless of your chosen medium. Visiting museums, attending talks, and connecting with other artists can broaden your perspectives and inspire new creative directions.

For pixel artists looking for inspiration, exploring the works of early computer artists or attending chiptune music events can be a great way to connect with the roots of the medium.

Digital illustrators might find inspiration in the works of concept artists for video games or films, or by attending digital art conferences and workshops.
