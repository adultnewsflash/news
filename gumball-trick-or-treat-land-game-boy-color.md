### A Return to Retro Aesthetics

The Game Boy Color, with its limited color palette and charmingly chunky pixels, holds a special place in the hearts of many gamers. The decision to develop "Gumball in Trick-or-Treat Land" for this platform is a bold move that speaks volumes about the developers' dedication to capturing the authentic retro experience. Expect to see meticulously crafted sprites, vibrant backgrounds (within the GBC's limitations, of course!), and animations that harken back to classic titles like *Pok√©mon Gold and Silver* or *The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX*.

### Apidya Blasts Back Too!

Interestingly, the Games Asylum website also reported that Amiga shooter *Apidya* is set to make a comeback in 2026, featuring new pixel art. This further illustrates the trend of reviving classic games with refreshed visuals that stay true to their roots. Both *Gumball* and *Apidya* represent how pixel art continues to be a relevant and exciting medium for game development.
