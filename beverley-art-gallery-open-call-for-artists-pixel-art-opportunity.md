# Beverley Art Gallery Calls for Artists: Could Your Pixel Art Shine?

Are you a budding or established digital artist looking for a platform to showcase your work? Beverley Art Gallery in the UK has announced an open call for artists, and it's a fantastic opportunity for creatives of all styles, including our beloved pixel art community! This is your chance to have your art seen by a wider audience and potentially become part of a prestigious exhibition. Let's dive into the details!

## An Open Door for Creative Talent

The Beverley Art Gallery's open exhibition is a yearly event designed to highlight the diverse talents within the artistic community. According to curator Hannah Willetts, this is a "wonderful opportunity for artists to share their talents". While the specific theme for this year's exhibition hasn't been explicitly announced, open calls often welcome a broad range of mediums and styles, making it perfect for digital artists looking to break into the physical art world.

### Why This Matters to Pixel Artists

Often, pixel art is perceived as solely belonging to the digital realm â€“ video games, online portfolios, and social media. However, this exhibition presents an exciting opportunity to challenge that perception and demonstrate the artistic merit of pixel art in a traditional gallery setting. Imagine your intricately designed 8-bit landscape or your charmingly animated character displayed alongside paintings and sculptures! This could be a significant step towards mainstream recognition for our favorite art form.

### Thinking Outside the Screen: Presenting Pixel Art in a Physical Gallery

Submitting digital art to a physical exhibition requires a bit of creative thinking. Here are some ideas on how you can translate your pixel art to a gallery-ready format:

*   **Prints:** High-quality prints on archival paper can showcase the detail and texture of your pixel art. Consider using a matte finish to minimize glare under gallery lighting.
*   **Acrylic Mounting:** Printing your art on clear acrylic offers a modern and visually striking presentation.
*   **LED Backlighting:** For a truly unique display, consider printing your art on translucent material and backlighting it with LEDs to mimic the glow of a screen.
*   **Animations on Screens:** Explore displaying animated pixel art on small screens or tablets within the gallery space. This requires careful consideration of looping animations and power sources, but can be a very effective way to showcase the dynamic nature of pixel art.
*   **Physical Installations:** Get creative with physical interpretations of pixel art! You could create mosaic-style pieces using tiles, beads, or even painted blocks to bring your digital creations into the real world.

## Getting Involved: How to Submit

Unfortunately, the original BBC news article doesn't include the specific details about the submission process. However, here's a general guide to help you prepare for an open call:

*   **Research the Gallery:** Familiarize yourself with Beverley Art Gallery's past exhibitions to understand their curatorial preferences and the types of art they typically showcase. Check out their website for information on exhibitions, artists, and the gallery's overall aesthetic.
*   **Prepare High-Quality Images:** Ensure you have high-resolution images of your artwork suitable for submission. Most galleries require digital images for initial review.
*   **Write a Compelling Artist Statement:** This is your chance to explain the inspiration behind your work, the techniques you used, and the message you hope to convey. Tailor your statement to highlight the relevance of your work to the gallery and its audience.
*   **Pay Attention to Deadlines and Guidelines:** Carefully read and adhere to all submission guidelines, including deadlines, file formats, and entry fees (if any). Missing deadlines or failing to follow instructions can automatically disqualify your submission.
*   **Visit the Website:** Check the Beverley Art Gallery website directly for submission details.
