# Spectrum Exhibition: Showcasing Female Artists in a Historic Gisborne Barn

**A vibrant new art collective is bringing a fresh perspective to Gisborne, New Zealand, with its inaugural exhibition, Spectrum. This showcase of female artists promises to be a celebration of creativity and talent, held in a unique and historic setting.**

## A New Dawn for Gisborne's Art Scene

Gisborne's art scene is set for a vibrant boost with the arrival of a new artist collective spearheaded by Sally Gaddum. The collective's first exhibition, titled "Spectrum," will feature the works of talented female artists, including Alexandra Boros and Karina McGregor. This promises to be an exciting event for both local art enthusiasts and visitors alike.

### A Historic Venue

What makes this exhibition even more special is its location: a beautifully restored historic barn. This unique setting will provide a charming and rustic backdrop for the diverse range of artwork on display, creating a truly immersive and memorable experience for attendees. Imagine pixel art prints nestled amongst the weathered wood beams, or retro-inspired illustrations reflecting the history of the space.

## Celebrating Female Artists

The focus on female artists is a powerful statement in itself. The "Spectrum" exhibition provides a platform to highlight the unique perspectives and creative voices of women in art. This is particularly important in a field where female artists have historically been underrepresented.

### The Artists to Watch

While the NZ Herald article specifically mentions Alexandra Boros and Karina McGregor, the collective likely includes other talented artists whose work will contribute to the overall diverse and colourful "Spectrum." Keep an eye out for updates and announcements about the full roster of participating artists! It's a great opportunity to discover new talents and be inspired by their unique styles and techniques. Perhaps they'll even draw inspiration from iconic pixel artists like eBoy or contemporary illustrators pushing the boundaries of retro aesthetics!
